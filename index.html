        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="about">
          The onslaught of cyber attacks against our enterprises, our citizens, and our country is increasing at an alarming rate. More than ever, businesses, both large and small, require uniquely qualified professionals who not only have a broad range of technical skills but also who understand business risks.

From 2008 - 2012, I served four years in the United States Marine Corps. as an 0321 Reconnaissance Marine. Needless to say, a security-focused mindset is at the core of who I am. Since leaving the military, I have carried that ethos with me, always holding myself to the highest of standards and continually pushing myself to be the very best version of me.
